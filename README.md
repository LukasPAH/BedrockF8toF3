# BedrockF8toF3 - for Windows 10

## AutoHotKey script that changes the paperdoll keybinding from F8 to F3 in the Minecraft Bedrock Edition window. Other windows besides the Bedrock Edition window will still have full F8 key functionality.

## Installation:
### Download the standalone executable from [here](https://github.com/LukasPAH/BedrockF8toF3/releases/latest) and run while playing Minecraft Windows 10 Edition. You may also place the executable in the following folder for it to run automatically:
```
%appdata%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup
```
